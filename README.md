Bible Sander is a macOS utility designed to process and organize Biblical text for sermons, academic work, or devotionals. It strips away verse numbers, formatting, and footnotes, making scripture clear and ready for word processors, slides, or study notes. Ideal for pastors, teachers, and theology students.
