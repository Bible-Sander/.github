## 🚀 Overview

**Bible Sander** is a specialized utility for macOS that allows students, pastors, teachers, and researchers to clean, prepare, and organize Biblical texts for study or presentation.  
Instead of manually removing footnotes, extra formatting, or non-essential references, Bible Sander automatically processes text so you can focus on content.  

With a few clicks, the tool can:  
- Strip away verse numbers and cross-references  
- Remove embedded formatting from different Bible software exports  
- Create clean passages ready for word processors, sermon notes, or presentation slides  
- Standardize text formatting for easier comparison across different translations  

It’s ideal for anyone who uses digital Bibles for research, teaching, or church services, helping reduce clutter and making the text clearer for audiences.

## ℹ️ About

Bible Sander was developed with simplicity in mind: to take exported text from Bible software or digital archives and quickly convert it into a clean, readable version.  
This is particularly helpful for pastors preparing sermons, students working on academic studies, or believers creating devotionals without distractions.  

While many Bible study apps include robust features, they often output text with unnecessary formatting. Bible Sander fills that gap, offering a **dedicated preprocessing step** that ensures any exported text is concise, visually clean, and presentation-ready.  

The tool supports a wide range of Bible file formats, works smoothly on modern macOS versions, and integrates with popular tools like Pages, Word, and Keynote. It’s lightweight, fast, and requires no complex configuration.
